Refactors for next time:
  -Figure out a better way to "book" a room for a block. Define what that means.
  -Determine clearer relationship btw reservation, singleres, and blockres
  -Reservation class could take on an id or guest attribute going forward. This might make more sense to help find reservations as well.
  -Clean up methods so they aren't so long - add more helper methods where possible
    *See find_reservations_by_date[] - way so that you don't have to loop through two different arrays?
    *See rooms_available[]
    *See create_block[]
  -Should room be a class? Does it need to know its cost??
  -More edge cases should be tested.
  -Names as a whole are very long. Find ways to shorten these while still making them easy to understand!
  -Use a .self method to create instances of block (see ada/week_6/api-wrapper-class.rb)
